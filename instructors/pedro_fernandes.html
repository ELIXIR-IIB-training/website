			    Pedro Fernandes graduated in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at IST (Universidade de Lisboa). He worked in Biomedical Engineering, Biophysics and Physiology and changed to Bioinformatics in 1990. He established the first user community in Portugal around the national service provided by the portuguese node of the EMBnet. In 1998 he created the Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics, GTPB that has provided a wide variety of user and developer skills to a total of more than 5000 course attendees throughout its eighteen years of existance. The provision of training in a coherent programme, with established training methods and a structured approach to meeting the evolving needs of the community, resulted in a standalone, reproducible and sustainable operation [Fernandes P L The GTPB training programme in Portugal Brief Bioinform (2010) 11 (6): 626-634. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbq063]. He currently teaches Bioinformatics both in graduate and undergraduate programmes. He is the Training Coordinator of Elixir Portugal and leads the Train-the-Researcher sub-task of the ELIXIR/EXECELERATE, a H2020 program to accelerate the start of the ELIXIR infrastructure provision initiative for biomedical data and bioinformatics tools. He is one of the founders of GOBLET, the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Education and Training, where he currently chairs the Learning, Education and Training Committee. Pedro is an ivited researcher at the University of Porto, Faculty of Medicine, and a consultant/instructor with H3ABioNet for the distance learning courses IBT and AGMT.
