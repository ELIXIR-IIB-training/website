Allegra Via is a physicist and scientific researcher at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) of the National Research Council (CNR, Rome, IT). In 2003, she got her PhD at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, where she also worked six years as postdoc. In 2009 she moved to the Sapienza University as researcher, and, since January 2014, she is the ELIXIR Italy Training Coordinator. She's involved in the design, organisation and delivery of bioinformatics training courses, in Train the Trainer activities, and collaborates with other ELIXIR’s nodes on many training-related initiatives. She has a long track record of academic teaching (Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Protein interactions). Her main research interests include protein structural bioinformatics, protein structure and function prediction and analysis, and protein interactions. She’s also strongly interested in what researchers have discovered about how people learn and how best to teach them, and how research findings in the science of learning (educational psychology) can be translated into common teaching practice. She’s a member of the Global Organisation of Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET) and a Software/Data Carpentry Instructor and Instructor trainer.
