### Important Dates 
- Deadline for applications: **XX-XX-2019**
- Course date: **XX-XX Month 2019**
<br>
<br>

### Venue
University of Torino<br>
Molecular Biotechnology Center<br>
Via Nizza, 52<br> 
10126 Torino, Italy<br>
[https://www.mbc.unito.it/it](https://www.mbc.unito.it/it)
<br>


### Fee 
The course does not include a fee, but the participants are expected to pay their own travel, meals and hotel costs (if any).

A maximum of **15** candidates will be selected based on their need for the course and their prerequisities as emerging from the application form. Priority will be given to candidates from ELIXIR-IIB member institutions (see the list at the bottom) and ELIXIR nodes. 

**Cancellation policy:** Attendance is limited to **15** participants. We expect many more applications. Accepted participants commit to attend the course for its whole duration. Failure to attend training sessions is disruptive. Moreover, it blocks other candidates from participating. Therefore a cancellation policy is in place so that only written requests presented 10 days in advance relatively to the course starting date are accepted.

### Course Description
Bioinformatics analysis typically integrate a large number of different tools, reference data to elaborate the input data and derive results. Reproducing the same analysis by other researchers is often a hard task as many pieces of the puzzle are missing from the used methodology.
While the raw datasets are generally available; a clear workflow detailing the results reproducibility is often missing. Indeed, a simple list of tools used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the result reproducibility: different releases of the same tools or/and of the system libraries (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky reproducibility issues. The biggest obstacle in computational reproducibility is then to create a reliable, standalone, multiplatform and lightweight-working environment in which all the computational needs for a study are installed and frozen. Virtualisation and containerisation are the two approaches proposed to address this issue.

Virtual machines are very good at isolating system resources and entire working environments, while , containers’ philosophy is to isolate only individual applications, not the entire system. Thus, containers are a lightweight fast and scalable alternative to Virtual machines when an completely isolated execution is not mandatory.

Docker is a container framework for Linux that allows a developer to make easier the creation, deployment, and execution of applications by using containers.
Recently it is becoming a promising approach to computational biology research reproducibility by:<br>
- Saving time and expenses on human and computational resources allocated to already performed analysis;
- Boosting communication between computational biologists working on similar topics;
- Enhancing transparency within the community;
- Granting open access computational knowledge to the community.
