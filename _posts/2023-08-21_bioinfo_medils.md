venue: Split, Croatia
description: We invite participants enthusiastic about science, new technologies, biology, big data analysis, and those curious to learn new things. The School will introduce participants to the latest advances in omics technologies and most commonly used bioinformatics tools and methods to analyse big data. Hands-on sessions will give participants the opportunity to reinforce the analysis concepts they learned in smaller groups based on their field of interest. The participants will also have a chance to get advice related to their own research questions. This School is intended for individuals working in life/biomedical sciences with little or none experience in bioinformatics.
