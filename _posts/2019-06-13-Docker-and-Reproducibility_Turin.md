### Course Description
Bioinformatics analysis typically integrate a large number of different tools, reference data to elaborate the input data and derive results. Reproducing the same analysis by other researchers is often a hard task as many pieces of the puzzle are missing from the used methodology. While the raw datasets are generally available; a clear workflow detailing the results reproducibility is often missing. Indeed, a simple list of tools used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the result reproducibility: different releases of the same tools or/and of the system libraries (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky reproducibility issues. The biggest obstacle in computational reproducibility is then to create a reliable, standalone, multiplatform and lightweight-working environment in which all the computational needs for a study are installed and frozen. Virtualization and containerization are the two approaches proposed to address this issue.

Virtual machines are very good at isolating system resources and entire working environments, while containers’ philosophy is to isolate only individual applications, not the entire system. Thus, containers are a lightweight fast and scalable alternative to Virtual machines when an completely isolated execution is not mandatory.

Docker is a container framework for Linux that allows a developer to make easier the creation, deployment, and execution of applications by using containers.
Recently it is becoming a promising approach to computational biology research reproducibility by:<br>
- Saving time and expenses on human and computational resources allocated to already performed analysis;
- Boosting communication between computational biologists working on similar topics;
- Enhancing transparency within the community;
- Granting open access computational knowledge to the community.
<br>
<br>


### Target audience
This course is aimed at providing to bioinformaticians and computer scientists the basic information to assemble docker images and use them.
<br>


### Course prerequisites
The participants will need to have basic shell scripting knowledge and basic experience in a scripting language, e.g. R,  Python, or others.
<br>
<br>

### Learning objectives
By the end of this course, the participants will learn:
- the basic concepts of Docker;
- to assess the advantages of a containerized software development & deployment;
- to use Docker engine features necessary for running containerized applications;
- how to use the Docker File and Docker Hub to create a Docker image;
- the various networking mechanisms available in Docker.
<br>

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, the participants will be able to:
- embed their own analysis pipelines in a Docker container using the docker file paradigm;
- use a Docker engine to execute containerized applications.
