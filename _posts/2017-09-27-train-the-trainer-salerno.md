description: The aim of this course is to get a deeper understanding of RNA-Seq experiments, providing a theoretical introduction to the data processing steps, together with practical sessions illustrating the use of the most popular data analysis tools. Some strategies are illustrated for detecting genes, which are differentially expressed across different biological conditions, alternative splicing products, novel isoforms and gene fusion events. Some methods for downstream analysis are described to give insight into how biological knowledge can be generated from RNA-Seq experiments.

## Description

ELIXIR-IIB, in cooperation with the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Train-The-Trainer programme, will hold a Train the Trainer (TtT) event in connection with a course on "Best Practices for RNA-Seq analysis". 

The course is made up of four sessions, covering: 

* [Learning principles and how they apply to training and teaching](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_1.md)
* [Teaching techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation] (https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_2.md)
* [Assessment and feedback in training and teaching] (https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_3.md)
* [Lesson, course, and materials design] (https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_4.md)


**Fee:** There is no course attendance fee. The participants will need to bear their travel and hotel costs (if any). ELIXIR-EXCELERATE will cover coffee breaks and lunches.
**Target audience:** People with a strong interest in becoming a teacher, or a better one.

### [Application form](https://goo.gl/forms/EJEoqXobj0MYflv22)
**We will accept a maximum of 15 participants.** Priority will be given to candidates from ELIXIR nodes. Notifications of acceptance will be sent shortly after the application, which will remain open until we reach 15 participants. 

### Target Audience
Whoever is interested in becoming a teacher or a better one. 
If you have questions like the following ones, this course may be very helpful to you.

* How learning works?
* How can I use learning principles to improve my teaching?
* How can I make my teaching more engaging and effective?
* How should I adjust my teaching to different types of learners?
* How can I help slow learners?
* How can I assess whether my students are actually understanding my lessons? Are they actually learning?
* What is the best balance between theory and practice?
* How can I best assess whether learning has occurred? 
* What works in a classroom and what doesn't?
* Etc.

### Learning Objectives:  
 * To get acquainted with Learning principles and how they apply to training
 * To be able to select and utilise training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation
 * To learn how to use assessment and feedback in training
 * To learn about session, course, and materials design

### Learning Outcomes:
 * Learners can name learning principles that a good teacher/instructor should have in mind
 * Learners can describe at least three training techniques, drawing on learning principles
 * Learners can design a training session and a course
 * Learners can develop assessment questionnaires
 * Learners can enumerate types of materials needed for each part of a training session or course
