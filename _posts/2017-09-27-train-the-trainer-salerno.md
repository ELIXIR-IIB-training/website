## Description

ELIXIR-IIB, in cooperation with the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Train-The-Trainer programme, will hold a Train the Trainer (TtT) event in connection with a course on "Best Practices for RNA-Seq analysis". 

The course is made up of four sessions, covering: 

* [Learning principles and how they apply to training and teaching](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_1.md)
* [Teaching techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_2.md)
* [Assessment and feedback in training and teaching](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_3.md)
* [Lesson, course, and materials design](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_4.md)

**Fee:** There is no course attendance fee. The participants will need to bear their travel and hotel costs (if any). ELIXIR-EXCELERATE will cover coffee breaks and lunches.

### [Application form](https://goo.gl/forms/EJEoqXobj0MYflv22)
**We will accept a maximum of 15 participants.** Priority will be given to candidates from ELIXIR nodes. Notifications of acceptance will be sent shortly after the application, which will remain open until we reach 15 participants. 

### Target Audience
Whoever is interested in becoming a teacher or a better one. 
If you have questions like the following ones, this course may be very helpful to you.

* How learning works?
* How can I use learning principles and theories to improve my teaching?
* How can I make my teaching more engaging and effective?
* How should I adjust my teaching to different types of learners?
* How can I help slow learners?
* How can I assess whether my students are actually understanding my lessons? Are they actually learning?
* What is the best balance between theory and practice?
* How can I best assess whether learning is occurring and/or has occurred? 
* What works in a classroom and what doesn't?
* How can I become a better teacher?
* Etc.

### Learning Objectives:
