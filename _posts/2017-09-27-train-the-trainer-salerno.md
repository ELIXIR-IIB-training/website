ELIXIR-IIB, in cooperation with the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Train-The-Trainer programme, will hold a Train the Trainer (TtT) event in connection with a course on "Best Practices for RNA-Seq analysis". 

The course is made up of four sessions, covering: 

* [Learning principles and how they apply to training and teaching](https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_1.md)
* [Teaching techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation] (https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_2.md)
* [Assessment and feedback in training and teaching] (https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_3.md)
* [Lesson, course, and materials design] (https://github.com/TrainTheTrainer/EXCELERATE-TtT/blob/master/TtT_session_4.md)


**Fee:** There is no course attendance fee. The participants will need to bear their travel and hotel costs (if any). ELIXIR-EXCELERATE will cover coffee breaks and lunches.
**Target audience:** People with a strong interest in becoming a teacher, or a better one.
