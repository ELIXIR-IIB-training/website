title: "Metabolomics and Integrative omics: from data production to analysis <font color='green'>[open]</font>"
date_start: 2022-04-28
date_end: 2022-04-29   
venue: Bari, Italy
description: The workshop is designed to enable the attendees to apply metabolomics in a research-based context. We will focus both on experimental design and data analysis of different data sources integrated at the level of the metabolome. Attendees will engage into the design of a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics experiment with cutting-edge equipment and will gain an overview on the use of specific software platforms for metabolomics data mining. Special attention will be paid to the integration of metabolomics data with metagenomics, gene expression and proteomic data.

### Course Description
Metabolomics is an emerging field of the Life Sciences arena and has widespread applications across the medical, clinical and biological sciences, both in academic and industrial settings. Metabolomics aims to measure the complement of metabolites (the intermediates and final products of metabolism) in living organisms and the environment. The total set of metabolites in a biological system is known as the metabolome and represents the downstream effect of an organism’s genome and its interaction with the environment.
This workshop is aimed to introduce metabolomics and describe the current challenges and limits in analyzing metabolites in a biological system. The following topics will be presented and discussed:
1.	Analytical theory and workflow of ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for metabolite measurements.
2.	Biological sample preparation in different metabolomics applications.
3.	Metabolomics data production and interpretation: metabolite identification and comprehensive data set of metabolites.
4.	Integration of metabolomics data with genomics and/or proteomics data.

### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of biology and/or biochemistry
<br>

###Target audience
Research scientists who are using or planning to use metabolomics analysis in their research activities are welcome to attend the workshop. <br> 
Participants are invited to present a use case by submitting to: <br> **< elixir.metabolomics2022@gmail.com >** <br>
(**email subject**: Abstract NAME SURNAME) <br>
an abstract (max 150 words) containing a short description of their research topic and the metabolomics issue/approach they wish to discuss with the speakers. The Organizing Committee will select ten abstracts for a flash presentation (3 min, 2 slides) and discussion during the roundtable on Friday, 29th April 2022 afternoon <br>
