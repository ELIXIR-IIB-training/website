description: Study methods in population genomics have been profoundly reshaped in the last few years thanks to the growing availability of complete genomic sequences at population level. The rapid and recent growth of data and methods calls for new approaches to become routine in evolutionary genomics laboratories. The objective of this Practical Course is to give an overview of state of the art methods in population genomics combining lecturing from outstanding experienced population geneticists and software developers. All conceptual innovation will be presented in lectures and applied in practice both individually and in group work.

Study methods in population genomics have been profoundly reshaped in the last few years thanks to the growing availability of complete genomic sequences at population level. The rapid and recent growth of data and methods calls for new approaches to become routine in evolutionary genomics laboratories. The objective of this Practical Course is to give an overview of state of the art methods in population genomics combining lecturing from outstanding experienced population geneticists and software developers. All conceptual innovation will be presented in lectures and applied in practice both individually and in group work.

Practicals includes computer exercises supervised by lecturers and training assistants. <br>
After attending the course participants will be aware of up-to-date concepts in population genetics, capable of running analyses using software based on whole genome data sequences and able to deal with basic aspects of any population genomics project.<br>

This Practical Course aims at evolutionary biologists who already have bioinformatics skills. PhD students and Post-Doc researchers will benefit the most out of this course, but applications from all candidates will be evaluated in their context.<br>
Participants will need to bring their own laptop in order to connect to a server to run the practical exercise. 

## Important Dates 
<b>Deadline for applications:</b> 5 February 2018 <br>
<b>Chosen participants will be notified by:</b> 28 February 2018<br> 
<b>Payment deadline:</b> 10 March 2018<br>

## Transport 
#### HOW TO REACH NAPOLI

#### ARRIVING IN NAPLES BY TRAIN

The central train stations is "Napoli Centrale" or "Napoli Piazza Garibaldi" (the same location). To book a train there are two train companies: Trenitalia and Italo. The train station is connected to the city by the metro Linea1.

#### ARRIVING IN NAPLES BY PLANE

From the International Airport Napoli Capodichino there are two ways to reach the city centre or the train station:

Bus - There is a bus called Alibus that you can take at the airport. Tickets are available on board (4 euros, only cash) or at the newspaper/souvenir shop in the airport ground floor (3 euros) and are valid for metro as well. The bus has two stops: first Piazza Garibaldi i.e. by the central train station, and second is by the city harbour where ships for the gulf islands leave.

Taxi - Ask for “tariffa predeterminata” (fixed fare) if you are going to one of the zones included in the offer. For the city centre or the train station it costs 16 euros, for Vomero area 23 euros. It is mandatory for taxi drivers to apply the fixed fare if required. Ask for the cost before starting the ride.

#### HOW TO REACH THE BIBLIOTECA AT CNR

The CNR is right outside the exit Montedonzelli of the metro Linea1. Check this website for more details. Once at the CNR reception you will find indications for the course. To enter the building it is mandatory to sign a registry of presence at the reception. You will be asked to sign when you enter for the first time in the morning and when you leave in the evening. This is a security requirement.

## Pompei - Ercolano

<table width="600">

<br>

[Pompei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii) and [Ercolano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ercolano) are two famous archaeological sites that lie in the shadow of [mount Vesuvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vesuvius), the active volcano that dominates the area.

They were destroyed by pyroclastic flows during the massive eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD.

Go to the central train station at Piazza Garibaldi. You'll find the Circumvesuviana (the train system that connects the Napoli and the towns and cities in the region around Vesuvius) on the lower level of the station. Buy tickets (about 3 euro each way) and take the Circumvesuviana to Pompei _Scavi_. Note that other regional trains go to the modern city of Pompei but you will need to walk about 25 minutes from that station to the archaeological site while the station Pompei Scavi is just a few minutes from the entrance to the park. A single cafeteria serves the site, so you may want to bring snacks. It can be hot and there is virtually no shade, so dress accordingly. Pompei is a vast ruin, and a walk through most of it should take at least three hours.

Ercolano lies on the same train line as Pompei, but is closer to Napoli. To get there, leave the Circumvesuviana at Ercolano Scavi, and walk down the hill towards the sea for about ten minutes. Ercolano is much smaller than Pompei, but what it lacks in size it makes up in the quality of its preservation. It is possible to visit both sites in one day, but you will probably want to start early.
