date_start:   2017-06-19
date_end:   2017-06-23
venue: Bari, Italy
description: Two connected events on Advanced Computational Metagenomics - a 2-day workshop followed by a three-day intensive practical school - will take place on 19-23 June 2017 in Bari, Italy. Both the workshop and the school will focus on the computational aspects of metagenomics analysis including reference databases, software and data retrieval and submission. The investigation of microbial communities will be discussed with an overview on real projects cases, both in ecological, clinical and nutrition fields. During the practical sessions students will experience how to analyze meta-barcoding and shotgun data from Next Generation Sequencing and to perform statistical inference on them.

<h2>Summer School in Advanced Computational Metagenomics</h2>
<h3>21-23 June, 2017 - Una Hotel Regina, Noicattaro, Bari, Italy</h3>

### School Description
The school will focus on the computational aspects of metagenomics analysis including reference databases, software and data retrieval and submission. The investigation of microbial communities will be discussed with an overview on real projects cases, both in ecological, clinical and nutrition fields.During the practical sessions students will learn how to analyse meta-barcoding and shotgun data from Next Generation Sequencing experiments and to perform statistical inference on them.

### Target audience
This course is aimed at researchers involved or embarking upon bioinformatic analysis in metagenomic projects. During the course, you will learn about:
- Analysis of meta-barcoding sequence data;- Analysis of shotgun Metagenomics sequence data;- Functional annotation of metagenomic data;- Methods for statistical comparisons of multiple metagenomic samples.

### Learning objectives
After this course you should be able to: 
- choose  and accomplish the most appropriate approach to analyse taxonomic composition and function of your metagenomics data;- perform metagenomic data submission and retrieval;- use statistical tools for comparative analysis of multiple samples;- use methods for pathway and network analysis in metagenomics projects.### Course prerequisites
No prior knowledge of metagenomic sequences analysis or specific programming skills are required. Conversely, a basic knowledge of BASH, Unix terminal usage and R are desirable.

### School's Instructors
- Marc Rosello & Guy Cochrane (EBI, UK); - Bruno Fosso & Monica Santamaria (IBBE-CNR, IT )- Gabriel Valiente (Technical University of Catalonia, SP)- Matteo Chiara (University of Milan, IT)
