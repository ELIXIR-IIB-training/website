title:  "RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq Course <font color='green'>[open]</font>"
date_start:  2020-03-09 
date_end: 2020-03-13   
venue: Torino, Italy
description: This course aims to provide participants with theoretical and practical knowledge on how to perform bioinformatic analyses of RNA-seq data using Bioconductor and other open-source software tools. A specific module will briefly describe the single-cell RNA-seq workflow, highlighting differences existing between bulk RNA-seq and single-cell sequencing. The course is suitable for life science researchers who are new to NGS technology, and no statistics prerequisites or computing experience are necessary for attending the course.

### Course Description
The course is based on the use of Bioconductor open-source software solutions. However, R coding skill is nor required. Furthermore, RNA-seq, miRNAseq and sigle-cell seq analyses will be performed using the tools available as part of the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project (Beccuti et al., Bioinformatics 2018: Kulkarni et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2018).
You can find here the complete [course description](https://github.com/kendomaniac/UNITORNASEQ/blob/master/booklet.pdf), together with the [program](https://github.com/kendomaniac/UNITORNASEQ/blob/master/program.pdf). 
<br>
<br>


### Target audience and prerequisites
The course is suitable for life science researchers who are new to NGS technology, and no statistics prerequisites or computing experience are necessary for attending the course.
<br>
<br>

### Laptop
Participants will be requested to bring their own laptop; in case of need we can provide a computer to participants.
The mandatory requirements for the laptop are the presence of an ethernet plug/adapter and VNC client installation.
<br>
<br>

### Learning objectives
By the end of this course, the participants will learn the importance of a good experimental design in order to ask sensible biological questions, face some typical issues that can arise by analysing RNA-seq data, and acquire basic skills in R scripting.
<br>
<br>

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, the participants will be able to:
- assess quality of data;
- complete basic statistical tests on NGS data;
- annotate and interpret data;
- perform clustering methods for cell sub-population discovery.
