### Course Description
With the rapid advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, genomic data has become one of the most widely analysed biological data. A variety of tools are available for different types of analyses; however, genomics research necessarily requires skills to create "ad hoc" scripts/software to deepen and extend the analysis.

By that motivation, the *[Societ√† Italiana di Diagnostica di Laboratorio Veterinaria (SIDiLV)](https://sidilv.org/)* and the *[Italian Infrastructure of Bioinformatics (IIB/ELIXIR Italy)](https://elixir-italy.org/about/)* organised the **School of Python for genomics** at the *[Italian National Institute of Health (ISS)](https://www.iss.it/en/web/guest/home)*.<br> 
The aim of the School is providing the necessary skills to utilise the Python language both for the use and development of software and for genomics data analysis in general.<br>
The School consists of 3 consequential modules:<br>
- *Basic module*: Introduction to Python programming
- *Advanced module*: Analyze your genomic data with Python
- *Hackathon module*: Python programming for developers

This *Basic module: Introduction to Python programming* starts from no programming knowledge and aims to provide learners the basics of the Python programming language, by applying them to assigned problems in the field of genomics. The course will be highly interactive and the students will continuously put theory into practice while learning. Learners will be also introduced to fundamental skills needed for working with their computers through a command-line interface (using the Linux shell).
<br>
<br>

### Prerequisites
No programming experience is required.
<br>
<br>

### Target audience
Research scientists at any stage of their career who are using or planning to use genomics data in their research activities are welcome to attend the workshop. <br> 
<br>
