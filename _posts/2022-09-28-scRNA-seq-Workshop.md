### Course Description
An introduction to single cell RNA-seq data analysis. This course aims to provide participants with theoretical and practical knowledge on how to perform bioinformatic analyses of scRNA-seq data using open-source software solutions. scRNA-seq analyses will be performed using the tools available as part of the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project: rCASC and its graphical interface.<br>
You can find here the complete **[course description and program](https://github.com/ELIXIR-IIB-training/website/tree/gh-pages/docs/booklet_v2.pdf)**. 
<br>
<br>


### Target audience and prerequisites
This course is suitable for biologists who are new to single cell gene
expression technology. Knowledge of statistics as well as computing skills are not necessary prior to attending the course.
<br>
<br>

### Laptop
Participants will be requested to bring their own laptop; in case of need organisers can provide a computer to participants.
<br>
<br>

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, the participants will be able to:
- explain the importance of experimental design to ask sensible biological questions at single cell level;
- assess the quality of data;
- describe limits and strength of data reduction and clustering in scRNA-seq;
- identify genes driving cluster formation in scRNA-seq;
- extract biological knowledge from cluster-specific biomarkers.
