date_start:   2017-10-18
date_end:   2017-10-19
venue: Palermo, Italy
description: Participants in the course will be introduced to protein-protein interactions, biochemical reactions and causal interactions field. During the course the participants will be exposed to the literature curation principles and methods. In addition, there will be a session dedicated to common standards and ontologies adopted to describe data retrieved from the literature in a formalized manner. A large number of molecular interaction resources and methodologies to analyze them will be introduced during hand-on sessions.

**IMPORTANT DATES**
- Course date: 18-19 October 2017
- Deadline for applications: 
    - early registration: September 23, 2017 
    - on-line registration: October 8, 2017

A maximum of **25** candidates will be accepted in the course. Priority will be given to NETTAB workshop participants on a first-come/first-served policy.

### Course Description
Participants in the course will be introduced to protein-protein interactions, biochemical reactions and causal interactions field. During the course the participants will be exposed to the literature curation principles and methods. In addition, there will be a session dedicated to common standards and ontologies adopted to describe data retrieved from the literature in a formalized manner. A large number of molecular interaction resources and methodologies to analyze them will be introduced during hand-on sessions.

Participants will get a general understanding of network construction, data analysis and modelling in bio-medical research. In particular, participants will be involved in hands-on session where they will be asked to analyse a dataset in the context of network analysis and modelling. Students will develop an understanding not only on static networks but also on discrete and continuous dynamical networks and how to simulate basic systems in order to derive meaningful information related to cancer.

The opening and closing lectures will be open and free to everyone but require application. 
Practical sessions are limited to **25** participants.
<br>

### Target audience
PhD students, postDoc and PIs in Life Sciences, Biomedicine and Bioinformatics with little or no knowledge of network biology tools, who are interested in learning how to apply such tools in their research.
<br>

### Learning objectives/outcomes
Participants will gain an understanding of:
<ul><li>protein interaction, biochemical reactions networks and pathway resources
</li>
<li>tools and standards for literature curation and network construction</li>
<li>methods of network-based data analysis</li>
<li>different approaches of mathematical modeling of networks</li>
</ul>
They will also learn:
<ul><li>how to perform biological network reconstruction, visualization, and analysis</li>
<li>how to integrate and visualize multi -omics data</li>
<li>how to perform pathways enrichment</li>
<li>applications in bio-medical research</li>
</ul>
<br>

### Course prerequisites
Knowledge of the following concepts: proteins, protein-protein interactions, pathways, ignaling data. Basic computer skills
<br>
<br>
