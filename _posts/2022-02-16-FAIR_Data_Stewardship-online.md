### Important Dates 
- Deadline for applications: **20-02-2022**
- Course date: **2-4-7-9-11 March, 2022** at **14.30 - 17.30** 
<br>
<br>


### Venue
On-line<br>
<br>


### Selection
The course does not include any fee. <br>
A maximum of **25** candidates will be selected based on their need for the course as emerging from the application form. Priority will be given to candidates from ELIXIR-IT member institutions (see the list at the bottom).
<br>

#### Cancellation policy 
Attendance is limited to 25 participants. We expect many more applications. Accepted candidates commit to attend the course for its whole duration. Failure to attend training sessions is disruptive; moreover, it blocks other candidates from participating. Therefore a cancellation policy is in place so that only written requests presented one week in advance relatively to the course starting date are accepted.

### Course Description
The course on FAIR Data Stewardship in Life Science has been organised by ELIXIR Italy, EOSC-Pillar Project, the ICDI Competence Centre, and EOSC-Life, in collaboration with ELIXIR Netherlands.

The course is focused on FAIR data management and stewardship. It provides the skills, tools, and standards required to embed Open Science in the research workflow, covering many aspects, such as: Open Science in Horizon Europe, Open Access in publishing, Research Data Management (RDM), FAIR principles, Open Data, and Data Management Plan. 
The course has been structured in 5 on-line training modules, each one built on frontal lessons and several interactions (detailed program will be available in the next future).
<br>
<br>


### Target audience
This course is in **Italian language** (with only one session in English by invited speakers from the Netherlands) aimed at life-science researchers, technicians, data stewards, and data managers, especially if they are involved in projects that require planning and writing a Data Management Plan.
