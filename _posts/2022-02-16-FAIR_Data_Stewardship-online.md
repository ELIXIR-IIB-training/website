On-line<br>
<br>


### Selection
The course does not include any fee. <br>
A maximum of **25** candidates will be selected based on their need for the course as emerging from the application form. Priority will be given to candidates from ELIXIR-IT member institutions (see the list at the bottom).
<br>

#### Cancellation policy: 
Attendance is limited to 25 participants. We expect many more applications. Accepted candidates commit to attend the course for its whole duration. Failure to attend training sessions is disruptive; moreover, it blocks other candidates from participating. Therefore a cancellation policy is in place so that only written requests presented one week in advance relatively to the course starting date are accepted.
