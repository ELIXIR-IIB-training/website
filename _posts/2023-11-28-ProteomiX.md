### Workshop description 
Since 2002 ProteomiX is a very informal meeting on technical problems related to Proteomics.
ProteomiX is an interactive workshop based on open discussion involving young researchers working on both experimental and computational aspects, such as protein extraction, interferences removal, separation, mass spectrometry analysis, database, quantitative and pathway analyses.
Researchers will be encouraged to propose a tentative title and few slides related to the problem, technical and practical aspects; these will be such as seeds to start discussion with all participants.
