description: Docker is an open source software that is used to run "containers" that are essentially lightweight virtual machines. Containers are isolated from each other and use their own set of tools and libraries; they can communicate through well-defined channels. This allows to easily deploy programs since all requisites of a program are stored inside the containers. This course will provide the basic notions and tool to allow a developer to "dockerize" her programs, and to manage a set of containers, hence greatly improving the installation process.

**IMPORTANT DATES** 
- Deadline for applications: **6 Sep 2018**
- Course date: **26-27 Sep 2018**
<br>


**VENUE:**
University of Milano-Bicocca<br>
[Lab. 715, U7 Building]( https://www.google.it/maps/place/Edificio+U7+-+Universit%C3%A0+degli+Studi+di+Milano+-+Bicocca/@45.5169838,9.2112628,16.75z)<br> 
via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi, 8<br> 
20126 Milano, Italy
<br>


**FEE:** 
The course does not include a fee, but the participants are expected to pay their own travel, meals and hotel costs (if any).


A maximum of **20** candidates will be selected based on their need for the course as emerging from the application form. Chosen participants will be notified by 10th September 2018. Priority will be given to candidates from ELIXIR-IIB member institutions (see the list at the bottom) and ELIXIR nodes. 

**Cancellation policy:** Attendance is limited to 20 participants. We expect many more applications. Accepted participants commit to attend the course for its whole duration. Failure to attend training sessions is disruptive. Moreover, it blocks other candidates from participating. Therefore a cancellation policy is in place so that only written requests presented 10 days in advance relatively to the course starting date are accepted.

### Course Description
Docker is used to run "containers" that are essentially lightweight virtual machines. Containers are isolated from each other and use their own set of tools and libraries; they can communicate through well-defined channels. This allows to easily deploy programs since all requisites of a program are stored inside the containers.
This course will provide the basic notions and tool to allow a developer to "dockerize" her programs, and to manage a set of containers, hence greatly improving the installation process.
<br>


### Target audience
This course is aimed at developers, DevOps in any field.
<br>


### Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, learners will be independently able to use docker to deploy their own applications, especially in an HPC setting, and to manage a set of coordinated docker applications.


### Course prerequisites
The participants will need to know how to execute and manage docker images (docker commands: run ps images)
