description: The objective of this EMBO Practical Course is to give an overview of state of the art methods in population genomics combining lecturing from outstanding experienced population geneticists and software developers. After attending the course participants will be aware of up-to-date concepts in population genetics, capable of running analyses using software based on whole genome data sequences and able to deal with basic aspects of any population genomics project. This EMBO Practical Course aims at evolutionary biologists who already have bioinformatics skills. PhD students and Post-Doc researchers will benefit the most out of this course, but applications from all candidates will be evaluated in their context.
