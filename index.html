The ELIXIR-IIB Training Platform is building a thriving community who strongly believes that quality training in bioinformatics is essential to achieve excellence in life science research. Thanks to a very motivated group of people, our programme is engaging an increasing number of passionate scientists interested in taking part in our training initiatives, activities and discussions.
<br>
Courses are mostly organised in collaboration with ELIXIR-IIB institutions and, whenever possible, in regions in need of a given expertise. They<!-- ,which are free,--> are limited to <b>20-30</b> participants to allow high interactivity and intensive practical work. Priority is given to candidates from ELIXIR-IIB institutions and other ELIXIR nodes. Instructors are selected among experts in the course's topic with experience in the application of advanced training practices and techniques.
<br>
We collaborate with other ELIXIR nodes in activities such as Train the Trainer, eLearning, EXCELERATE use cases' training support and we have a pilot to provide training support to extra-European countries.
<br>
